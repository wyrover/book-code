Sounds for the Rhino PPM model by Eric vonRothkirch

Interesting note: I actually looked up some actual sounds
that rhinoceros make, just to see what kind of sounds
I should mimic. But of course, I did it in a more "evil" way.

Hope you enjoy... 

Any comments, feedback etc. would be greatly appreciated.
