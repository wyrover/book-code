===============================
THE APPLICATION WILL NOT START:
===============================

For best results download the application and help file to a local drive instead of a network drive.
If the application does not start, ensure that you have the .NET Framework version 2 or greater
installed on your computer. This can be obtained from Microsoft's web site.
We do not install the .NET Framework.  


======================================
THE HELP FILE CONTENTS CANNOT BE READ:
======================================

If the help file contents cannot be read (a typical message is "this program cannot display the webpage"
or "navigation to the webpage was cancelled"), then it is likely that one of the following conditions exist:

1. The .chm file is being blocked by your firewall. The solution for this is to right-click on the .chm file,
select "Properties", and look for an "Unblock" button on the properties dialog - if you see this button
click it to resolve the problem.

2. The .chm file is not in the same folder as the .exe file. Ensure that the .chm file is in the same
folder.

3. The folder containing the .chm file has a '#' or '+' or '&' character in its name. The solution is to rename the
folder to remove the character or move the .exe and .chm files to another folder.
