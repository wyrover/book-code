       ATL SERVER : Beverage Project Overview
========================================================================

AppWizard has created this Beverage application for you.  This application
not only demonstrates the basics of using the ATL Server Classes but is also a starting 
point for writing your application.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your Beverage application.

Beverage.vcproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and 
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.
 
Beverage.h
    This file contains your ATL Server request handler class customized based on the 
    options you chose in the the ATL Server Wizard.
 
Beverage.srf
    This file contains a starter SRF (Server Response File) for your application.
    It shows a sample usage of the replacement tag {{Hello}} which is 
    associated with the OnHello method in the CBeverageHandler class.
