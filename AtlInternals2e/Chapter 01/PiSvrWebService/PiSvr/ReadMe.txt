       ATL SERVER : PiSvr Project Overview

AppWizard has created this PiSvr application for you.  This application
not only demonstrates the basics of using the ATL Server Classes but is also a starting 
point for writing your application.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your PiSvr application.

PiSvr.vcproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and 
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.
 
PiSvr.h
    This file contains your ATL Server request handler class customized based on the 
    options you chose in the the ATL Server Wizard.

    This file contains information that allows your web service to be exposed via
    web servers supporting the DISCO protocol.
