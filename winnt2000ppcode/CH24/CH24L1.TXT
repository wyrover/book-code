TOTALIO.SYS -- by Dale Roberts
Compile: Use DDK BUILD facility
Purpose: Give direct port I/O access to the whole system. This driver grants
total system-wide I/O access to all applications. Very dangerous, but useful
for short tests.  Note that no test application is required. Just use control
panel or "net start totalio" to start the device driver.  When the driver is
stopped, total I/O is removed.  Because no Win32 app needs to communicate with
the driver, we don’t have to create a device object. So we have a tiny driver
here. Since we can safely extend the TSS only to the end of the physical memory
page in which it lies, the I/O access is granted only up to port 0xf00.
Accesses beyond this port address will still generate exceptions.
