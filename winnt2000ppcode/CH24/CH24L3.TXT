/* From inpection of the TSS we know that NT's default IOPM offset is 0x20AD.

 * process, so that I/O access can be granted on a process-by-process basis.
 * This portion of the process structure is not documented in the DDK.
 * This kernel mode driver fragment illustrates the brute force
 * method of poking the IOPM base into the process structure. */
